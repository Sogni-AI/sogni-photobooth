# Tab Sync Bug Fix - Demo Mode Switch Prevention

## Issue
When opening a new tab while logged in, the first tab showed a weird render instead of the session transfer modal.

## Root Cause
The cosmetic logout was working correctly, but the App component was detecting the logout and automatically switching to demo mode, causing UI issues.

### What Was Happening:
1. User opens new tab → Tab sync detects new authenticated tab
2. Old tab receives notification → Triggers cosmetic logout
3. Cosmetic logout sets `isAuthenticated: false`, `authMode: null`
4. **Bug**: App.jsx detects logout → Switches to demo mode
5. UI transitions to demo mode → Weird render/flicker
6. Session transfer modal tries to show but UI is already changing

### Expected Behavior:
1. User opens new tab → Tab sync detects new authenticated tab
2. Old tab receives notification → Triggers cosmetic logout
3. Cosmetic logout sets `isAuthenticated: false`, `authMode: null`, `sessionTransferred: true`
4. **Fixed**: App.jsx sees `sessionTransferred` flag → Skips demo mode switch
5. UI stays in current state (frozen)
6. Session transfer modal displays cleanly

## Fix Applied

### File: `src/App.jsx`

**Before:**
```javascript
} else if (!isNowAuthenticated && authState.authMode === null && wasAuthenticated) {
  // User logged out - ONLY trigger if they were previously authenticated
  console.log('🔐 User logged out, switching back to demo mode (backend client)');
  
  // Clear the current client
  setSogniClient(null);
  setIsSogniReady(false);
  
  // Reinitialize with backend client
  initializeSogni();
  
  // Re-enable QR watermark for anonymous users (needed for attribution)
  if (settings.sogniWatermark === false) {
    console.log('💧 Re-enabling QR watermark for anonymous user');
    updateSetting('sogniWatermark', true);
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
} else if (!isNowAuthenticated && authState.authMode === null && wasAuthenticated && !authState.sessionTransferred) {
  // User logged out - ONLY trigger if they were previously authenticated
  // Skip if this is a cosmetic logout (session transferred to new tab)
  console.log('🔐 User logged out, switching back to demo mode (backend client)');
  
  // Clear the current client
  setSogniClient(null);
  setIsSogniReady(false);
  
  // Reinitialize with backend client
  initializeSogni();
  
  // Re-enable QR watermark for anonymous users (needed for attribution)
  if (settings.sogniWatermark === false) {
    console.log('💧 Re-enabling QR watermark for anonymous user');
    updateSetting('sogniWatermark', true);
  }
} else if (!isNowAuthenticated && authState.authMode === null && wasAuthenticated && authState.sessionTransferred) {
  // Cosmetic logout due to session transfer - don't switch to demo mode
  // Just let the UI stay in its current state and show the session transfer modal
  console.log('🔄 Session transferred to new tab - keeping UI frozen, showing modal');
}
```

**Dependency Array Updated:**
```javascript
}, [authState.isAuthenticated, authState.authMode, authState.sessionTransferred, initializeSogni, settings.sogniWatermark, updateSetting]);
```

## Key Changes

1. **Added `!authState.sessionTransferred` check** to the logout condition
   - Only switches to demo mode on REAL logout
   - Skips demo mode switch on cosmetic logout

2. **Added separate handler for cosmetic logout**
   - Logs session transfer event
   - Keeps UI frozen in current state
   - Allows modal to display properly

3. **Updated dependency array**
   - Added `authState.sessionTransferred` to trigger effect when flag changes

## Testing Results

### Before Fix:
```
🚨 New authenticated tab detected
🔄 New authenticated tab detected, performing cosmetic logout in this tab
🎭 Performing cosmetic logout (UI only, no API call)
✅ Cosmetic logout complete - UI updated
🔐 User logged out, switching back to demo mode (backend client)  ← ❌ BAD
Using backend authentication (demo mode - shared demo credits)
💧 Re-enabling QR watermark for anonymous user
```

### After Fix:
```
🚨 New authenticated tab detected
🔄 New authenticated tab detected, performing cosmetic logout in this tab
🎭 Performing cosmetic logout (UI only, no API call)
✅ Cosmetic logout complete - UI updated
🔄 Session transferred to new tab - keeping UI frozen, showing modal  ← ✅ GOOD
[Session transfer modal displays cleanly]
```

## Impact

- ✅ No more weird renders when opening new tabs
- ✅ No unnecessary demo mode switches
- ✅ Clean session transfer modal display
- ✅ UI stays stable during cosmetic logout
- ✅ No performance impact (same code path, just better condition)
