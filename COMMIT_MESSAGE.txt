feat: Implement direct login/signup with Photobooth branding

Replace external redirect (app.sogni.ai) with in-app authentication using Sogni API.
Users can now login/signup directly in Photobooth with custom-branded modals.

- Created multi-step signup flow (username/email → password → review → welcome)
- Added LoginForm with username/password validation
- Integrated Cloudflare Turnstile for bot protection
- Implemented browser password manager support (autocomplete, strong password suggestions)
