The rhythm is powered by a punchy, hard-clipped drum kit and an overdriven, distorted 808 bass typical of phonk. A deep, low-pitched male vocal delivers a raw rap performance, characterized by a monotone, chant-like flow and heavy processing including saturation, phasing, distortion, and tape-style compression.
